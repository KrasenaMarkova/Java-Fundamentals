//You will be given two hands of cards, which will be integer numbers. Assume that you have two players.
// You must find the winning deck and, respectively, the winner.
//You start from the beginning of both hands. Compare the cards from the first deck to those from the second.
// The player, who has a bigger card, takes both cards and puts them on the back of his hand -
// the second player's card is last, and the first person's card (the winning one) is before it (second to last),
// and the player with the smaller card must remove the card from his deck. If both players'
// cards have the same values - no one wins, and the two cards must be removed from the decks.
// The game is over when one of the decks is left without any cards. You have to print the winner on the console
// and the sum of the left cards: "{First/Second} player wins! Sum: {sum}".
