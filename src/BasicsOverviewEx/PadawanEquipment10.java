//Yoda is starting his newly created Jedi academy. So, he asked Master George Lucas to buy the needed
// equipment. The number of items depends on how many students will sign up. The equipment for the
// Padawan contains lightsabers, belts, and robes.
//You will be given the amount of money George Lucas has, the number of students, and the prices of
// each item. You have to help George Lucas calculate if the money he has is enough to buy all of the
// equipment or how much more money he needs.
//Because the lightsabers sometimes break, George Lucas should buy 10% more, rounded up to the next
// integer. Also, every sixth belt is free.
//Input / Constraints
//The input data should be read from the console. It will consist of exactly 5 lines:
//•	The amount of money George Lucas has – the floating-point number in the range [0.00…1,000.00].
//•	The count of students – integer in the range [0…100].
//•	The price of lightsabers for a single saber – the floating-point number in the range [0.00…100.00].
//•	The price of robes for a single robe – the floating-point number in the range [0.00…100.00].
//•	The price of belts for a single belt – the floating-point number in the range [0.00…100.00].
//The input data will always be valid. There is no need to check it explicitly.
